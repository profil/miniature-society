Miniature Society
=================
What is this?
-------------
You're a lone traveller finding your way around the universe.
You enter a small society, where there are craftsmen, labourers, merchants and other people which do one thing and they do it well.
You want to get in contact with these fine business and retrieve service or products from them.
Your problem is that you can't find these people, because you don't know where they are. To your happiness there is a mayor in this small society, and he knows much about everyone.

So you go to the mayor, which is the only one you can find, and ask him where you can get help with your particular problem. He explains the way there and then tell you good luck to your search.
You find that special craftsman you were looking for, he solves your problem and everything is fine again. You say goodbye and he says "Welcome back my lovely Gentleman!"

THE END.
